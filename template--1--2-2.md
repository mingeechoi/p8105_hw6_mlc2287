# Problem 2

Create city_state variable and binary variable indicating whether
homicide is solved.

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Omit certain cities and Tulsa, AL. Limit analysis for whom victim_race
is white or black. Make sure victim_age is numeric.

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Fit logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as outcome and
victim and age, sex, and race, as predictors.Save glm as R object.

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Apply broom: tidy to object and obtain estimate and confidence interval
of adjusted OR for solving homicides comparing male to female victims,
keeping all other variable fixed.

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Run glm for each cities in dataset and extract adjusted OR and CI for
solving homicides comparing male to female victims.

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Plot that shows estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100
